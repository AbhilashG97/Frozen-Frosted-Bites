# Python basics

This document will contain a short demo of the python language - 

1.  **Loops**
    Loops in python follow this syntax - 
    ```python
    for token in tokens:
    ````
    :warning:   To print items of a collection in single line, you have to do the following:

    ```python
    for(item in items)
        print(item, end=" ")
    ```

2. **Strings**
    Strings are immutable in python. They can be enclosed in single, double, triple quotes.
    
    :warning:   Strings in triple quotes can be written in multiple lines.

    :warning:   Multiplication can also be performed on strings.

    ```python 
        print(".-." * 4)
    ```
